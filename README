SSH TRANSFER HACKS

  NIC          
    arnold has public facing IP, only one allowed to access NIC
    connect through arnold using ssh's ProxyCommand and netcat
     - see .ssh/config entry for NIC
     - ControlMaster turned off for overseer entry so proxycommand always works as expected 
  
  MRRC (meson)   
    public key authentication broken, use "expect" to enter password
      and fork keep alive connection

      expect compiled without root, needs LD_LIBRARY_PATH and PATH to be configured

    enable ControlMaster so that this forked connection 
       provides passwordless entry for other connections

    can then check existance of ControlPath to see if we need to reconnect

     - see .ssh/config entry for *
